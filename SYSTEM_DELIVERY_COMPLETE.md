## 🔄 System Flow

### Bidding Phase
1. User enters bid amount
2. System checks guarantee deposit balance (5% of base price)
3. First-time bidders have 5% blocked as guarantee
4. Previous highest bidder amount is unblocked
5. New bid becomes current highest bid
6. Notifications sent to affected users

### Auction Ending Phase
1. System detects auction end_time has passed
2. All participants ranked by highest bid
3. Top 3 selected as potential winners
4. Non-top-3 deposits released immediately
5. 48-hour payment deadline created for rank 1
6. Notification sent to rank 1 winner

### Payment Phase
1. Winner receives payment deadline notification
2. Winner has 48 hours to complete payment

4. If paid: Commission deducted (2%), seller receives remainder
5. If deadline expires: Deposit burned, rank 2 selected
6. Line delivery workflow triggered on successful payment
