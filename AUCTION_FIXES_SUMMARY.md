# ðŸŽ‰ Auction System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Guarantee Deposit Deduction on Every Bid
**Problem**: Users were having the 5% guarantee deposit deducted from their wallet balance on every bid, not just the first bid.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified the `placeBidWithGuaranteeDeposit` function in `services/auction-guarantee-system.ts`
- Now only deducts the 5% guarantee deposit from wallet balance on the first bid
- Subsequent bids only block the bid amount without additional guarantee deductions
- Fixed the balance calculation to only include guarantee deposit for first-time bidders

### 2. âœ… Final Payment Calculation Issue
**Problem**: When a user won an auction with a base price of 1M and a winning bid of 2M, they were paying the full 2M instead of 1.95M (2M - 50K guarantee deposit).

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `processAuctionWinnerPayment` function in `services/auction-guarantee-system.ts`
- Modified `completeAuctionPurchaseForWinner` function in `services/api-supabase.ts`
- Now calculates the actual payment amount as: `bid_amount - guarantee_deposit_amount`
- Commission (2%) is calculated based on the actual payment amount, not the full bid amount
- Guarantee deposit is refunded to the winner's wallet after payment completion
- Updated the payment confirmation modal in `SimDetailsPage.tsx` to show correct payment amount

### 3. âœ… Won Auction SIM Cards Not Appearing in Buyer's Purchase Tracking
**Problem**: After winning and completing an auction, the SIM card wasn't appearing in the buyer's purchase tracking section.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Ensured `completeAuctionFlow` function in `services/auction-guarantee-system.ts` properly creates purchase orders
- Verified that purchase orders are created with correct status and line type information
- Confirmed that the line delivery process is properly initiated after auction completion
- Purchase orders should now appear in the buyer's dashboard under "Ø®Ø±ÛŒØ¯Ù‡Ø§ÛŒ Ù…Ù†"
