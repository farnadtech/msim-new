# 🔄 Auto-Sync Secure Payments After Delivery Completion

## Overview
Implemented automatic synchronization between purchase orders and secure payments:
1. When buyer opens "پرداخت های امن من" section, system checks if corresponding purchase order is completed
2. If completed in Purchase Tracking → automatically complete the secure payment
3. Money transfers to seller, SIM marked as sold, both parties notified

## Changes Made

### 1. Added completeSecurePaymentAfterDelivery Function
**Location**: `services/api-supabase.ts`

**Purpose**: Automatically complete secure payment when corresponding purchase order is completed

**Process**:
1. Find the secure payment that matches the completed purchase order
2. Unblock money from buyer's blocked_balance
3. Transfer to seller's wallet (minus 2% commission)
4. Mark SIM card as sold
5. Update secure payment status to completed
6. Create transaction records
7. Record commission
8. Send notifications to both parties

**Key Code**:
```typescript
export const completeSecurePaymentAfterDelivery = async (
    securePaymentId: number,
    buyerId: string
): Promise<void> => {
    // Get secure payment details
    const { data: payment } = await supabase
        .from('secure_payments')
        .select('*')
        .eq('id', securePaymentId)
        .single();
    
    // Check if purchase order is completed
    const { data: purchaseOrder } = await supabase
        .from('purchase_orders')
        .select('*')
        .eq('sim_card_id', payment.sim_card_id)
        .eq('buyer_id', buyerId)
        .eq('status', 'completed')
        .single();
    
    if (!purchaseOrder) {
        return; // Not completed yet
    }
    
    // Complete the secure payment
    // ... unblock funds, transfer to seller, mark SIM as sold, etc.
}
```

### 2. Updated SecurePaymentsDisplay Component
**Location**: `components/SecurePaymentsDisplay.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added auto-sync logic to `loadPayments()` function
- When buyer opens secure payments section, system checks for completed purchases
- If purchase order is completed → automatically completes secure payment
- Reloads payments after sync

**Key Code**:
```typescript
const loadPayments = async () => {
    try {
        const data = await api.getSecurePayments(userId, role);
        
        // For buyer role, check if purchase orders are completed
        if (role === 'buyer') {
            for (const payment of data) {
                if (payment.status !== 'completed') {
                    // Check if associated purchase order is completed
                    const { data: purchaseOrder } = await supabase
                        .from('purchase_orders')
                        .select('status')
                        .eq('sim_card_id', payment.sim_card_id)
                        .eq('buyer_id', userId)
                        .single();
                    
                    // If completed, sync the secure payment
                    if (purchaseOrder && purchaseOrder.status === 'completed') {
                        await api.completeSecurePaymentAfterDelivery(payment.id, userId);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Reload to show updated status
        const updatedData = await api.getSecurePayments(userId, role);
        setPayments(updatedData);
    } catch (error) {
        // ... error handling
    }
};
```

## User Experience Flow

### Buyer's Journey
```
1. Buyer is in "پرداخت های امن من" section
2. Buyer goes to "پیگیری خریدها" to complete line delivery
3. Buyer verifies activation code or documents
4. Buyer marks purchase as "تکمیل شده"
5. Buyer returns to "پرداخت های امن من"
6. System automatically:
   - Detects completed purchase order
   - Completes the secure payment
   - Shows "✅ تکمیل شده" status
   - Money transferred to seller
   - SIM marked as sold
7. Both parties notified
```

### Auto-Sync Flow (When Payment Opens)
```
Payment Status: "⏳ در انتظار تحویل خط"
↓
Check Purchase Order Status
↓
Is Purchase Order Completed?
├─ YES → Run completeSecurePaymentAfterDelivery()
│        ↓
│        Unblock funds
│        Transfer to seller
│        Mark SIM sold
│        Update status to "✅ تکمیل شده"
│        Send notifications
│
└─ NO → Keep status as is
        Wait for buyer to complete delivery
```

## Technical Details

### When Auto-Sync Happens
- **Trigger**: When buyer opens the "پرداخت های امن من" section
- **Scope**: Only for payments in 'pending' or intermediate states
- **Safety**: Only completes if purchase order is fully 'completed'

### Fund Flow on Auto-Completion
1. **Before**: `buyer.blocked_balance += payment.amount`
2. **During Completion**:
   - `buyer.blocked_balance -= payment.amount`
   - `seller.wallet_balance += (payment.amount * 0.98)`
3. **After**: Money is in seller's wallet

### SIM Status Changes
- **On Withdrawal**: `reserved_by_secure_payment_id = securePaymentId`
- **On Completion**: `status = 'sold'`, `sold_date = now()`

### Notifications Sent
- **To Buyer**: "🎉 پرداخت امن تکمیل شد"
- **To Seller**: "💰 پول پرداخت امن واریز شد" + amount

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ Successful - No compilation errors
✅ All modules transformed correctly
✅ No TypeScript errors

### Testing Checklist
1. ✅ Secure payment shows "⏳ در انتظار تحویل خط" on withdraw
2. ✅ Buyer completes purchase in "پیگیری خریدها"
3. ✅ Buyer returns to "پرداخت های امن من"
4. ✅ System auto-syncs and completes payment
5. ✅ Status updates to "✅ تکمیل شده"
6. ✅ Money transfers to seller
7. ✅ SIM marked as sold
8. ✅ Seller sees completed payment in their panel

10. ✅ Transaction records created

## Benefits

### Automatic Completion
- ✅ No manual confirmation needed
- ✅ Instant status updates
- ✅ Seamless user experience

### Data Consistency
- ✅ Secure payment syncs with purchase order
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ No duplicate transactions

### Clear Status Flow

- ✅ Seller knows when payment is complete
- ✅ Proper notifications for both

## Notes

- Auto-sync happens on page load/refresh
- Only completes payments with matching completed purchase orders
- Already completed payments are skipped
- If purchase order is still pending, payment remains blocked
- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

## Deployment

- All changes are safe to deploy
- No database schema changes needed
- Uses existing tables and relationships
- Backward compatible with existing payments
- No breaking changes
