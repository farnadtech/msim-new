## 🔧 How It Works Now

### User Places Bid
```
1. User enters bid amount on auction
2. System checks: balance >= (5% of base + bid amount)
3. If first bid: 5% blocked as guarantee deposit
4. Bid amount blocked
5. Notification sent
```

### Auction Ends
```
1. System auto-processes every 60 seconds
2. Ranks all bidders by highest amount
3. Selects top 3 as potential winners
4. Releases deposits for others
5. Notifies all users
```

### Payment Processing (48 Hours)
```
1. Winner gets 48-hour deadline
2. System checks deadline on every page refresh
3. If paid: Complete auction + transfer funds
4. If not paid after 48hrs: 
   - Burn guarantee deposit
   - Notify next winner
   - Escalate (repeat for top 3)
5. If all fail: Cancel auction
```

### Final Completion
```
1. Winner's deposit released
2. 2% commission deducted
3. Funds transferred to seller
4. Line delivery process starts
5. All parties notified
```
