# 🎉 Complete Auction Bidding Logic Fix

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Balance Being Reduced by Bid Amount
**Problem**: When a user placed a bid, their wallet balance was being reduced by the bid amount PLUS the guarantee deposit

**Root Cause**: Code was deducting bid amount from wallet then AGAIN deducting guarantee deposit

**Fix**: ONLY deduct guarantee deposit (5% of base price) on first bid, NEVER deduct bid amount

### Bug #2: Previous Bidder Balance Goes to Zero
**Problem**: When outbid, previous bidder's balance was being restored incorrectly, often going to 0

**Root Cause**: Code was trying to unblock "bid amount" that was never blocked in the first place

**Fix**: Don't touch previous bidder's balance when outbid - their guarantee deposit stays blocked until auction ends

## Correct Auction Financial Logic

### How It Should Work
1. **First Bid**: Deduct ONLY guarantee deposit (5% of base price) from wallet
2. **Subsequent Bids**: NO additional deductions (guarantee already blocked)
3. **When Outbid**: Previous bidder keeps guarantee blocked, no balance changes
4. **Auction Ends**: 
   - Top 3: Keep guarantee blocked (needed for payment)
   - Others: Guarantee released back to wallet

### Example Flow
```
Base Price: 1,000,000 Tomans
Guarantee Deposit: 50,000 Tomans (5%)

User A starts with 100,000 Tomans
1. User A bids 500,000:
   - Wallet: 100,000 - 50,000 = 50,000 ✅
   - Blocked: 0 + 50,000 = 50,000 ✅
   - Bid recorded: 500,000 (NOT deducted from wallet)

2. User B bids 600,000:
   - User B: Wallet reduced by 50,000 (their guarantee)
   - User A: NO CHANGE (still has 50,000 in wallet, 50,000 blocked)

3. User A bids 700,000:
   - User A: NO CHANGE (already has guarantee blocked)
   - User B: NO CHANGE (keeps guarantee blocked)

Auction Ends:
- User A (highest): Keeps 50,000 blocked
- User B (2nd): Keeps 50,000 blocked  
- User C (4th+): Gets 50,000 back
```

## Code Changes Made

### File: `services/auction-guarantee-system.ts`

#### Change 1: Fixed Balance Deduction Logic
**Before** (Lines 148-163):
```typescript
// WRONG: Deducting bid amount from wallet
const newBidderBalance = bidderWalletBalance - amount - guaranteeDepositAmount;
const newBidderBlockedBalance = bidderBlockedBalance + guaranteeDepositAmount;

// Then AGAIN deducting guarantee
const guaranteeBalance = newBidderBalance - guaranteeDepositAmount;
```

**After**:
```typescript
// CORRECT: Only deduct guarantee deposit, NEVER bid amount
if (isFirstBid && guaranteeDepositAmount > 0) {
    const newBidderBalance = bidderWalletBalance - guaranteeDepositAmount;
    const newBidderBlockedBalance = bidderBlockedBalance + guaranteeDepositAmount;

    await supabase
        .from('users')
        .update({
            wallet_balance: newBidderBalance,
            blocked_balance: newBidderBlockedBalance
        })
        .eq('id', bidderId);
```

#### Change 2: Removed Incorrect Balance Restoration
**Before** (Lines 115-145):
```typescript
// WRONG: Trying to unblock bid amount that was never blocked
const amountToUnblock = auctionDetails.current_bid;
await supabase
    .from('users')
    .update({
        wallet_balance: (prevBidderData.wallet_balance || 0) + amountToUnblock,
        blocked_balance: Math.max(0, (prevBidderData.blocked_balance || 0) - amountToUnblock)
    })
    .eq('id', previousHighestBidderId);
```

**After**:
```typescript
// CORRECT: Don't touch previous bidder's balance
// Their guarantee stays blocked until auction ends
const previousHighestBidderId = auctionDetails.highest_bidder_id;
if (previousHighestBidderId && previousHighestBidderId !== bidderId) {
    // Just notify the outbid user
    await createNotification(
        previousHighestBidderId,
        '❌ پیشنهاد شما بالاتر شد',
        `پیشنهاد شما برای سیمکارت ${simData?.number} توسط پیشنهاد دیگری بالاتر شد`,
        'warning'
    );
}
```

## Admin Auction Participants View

### Component: `AdminAuctionParticipantsPanel.tsx`

**Features**:
- Shows ALL participants in the auction
- Sorted by highest bid (rank 1, 2, 3...)
- Displays each participant's:
  - Rank
  - Name
  - Highest bid
  - Number of bids
  - Guarantee deposit status
  - Winner status (top 3)

**Usage**: Admin clicks on auction → sees full list of participants

**View**:
```
🏆 Rank 1: احمد - 1,500,000 تومان - 3 bids - 50,000 ⛓️ - ✅ برنده احتمالی
🏆 Rank 2: محمد - 1,400,000 تومان - 5 bids - 50,000 ⛓️ - ✅ برنده احتمالی
🏆 Rank 3: علی - 1,300,000 تومان - 2 bids - 50,000 ⛓️ - ✅ برنده احتمالی
   Rank 4: رضا - 1,200,000 تومان - 1 bid - 50,000 Released - شامل نشد
```

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ Successful - No compilation errors
✅ All modules transformed correctly
✅ No TypeScript errors

### Test Scenarios
1. ✅ User places first bid → Only guarantee deducted
2. ✅ User places second bid → No additional deduction
3. ✅ User gets outbid → Balance unchanged
4. ✅ Multiple users bidding → All balances correct
5. ✅ Admin views participants → Full list with correct data
6. ✅ Auction ends → Guarantees handled correctly

## Deployment

- All changes are safe to deploy
- No database schema changes needed
- Uses existing tables and relationships
- Backward compatible
- Critical bug fixes applied
