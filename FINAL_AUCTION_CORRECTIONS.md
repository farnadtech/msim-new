# ðŸŽ‰ Final Auction System Corrections

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Guarantee Deposit Handling
**Problem**: Guarantee deposit was being refunded to the buyer after auction completion.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed the guarantee deposit refund logic
- The full bid amount is now paid by the buyer
- The full bid amount (minus 2% commission) goes to the seller
- Guarantee deposit remains part of the transaction and is marked as "completed"

### 2. âœ… Line Delivery Process Activation
**Problem**: The line delivery process (activation codes, purchase orders) wasn't being triggered after auction completion.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Ensured `completeAuctionFlow` is properly called after payment completion
- Fixed error handling to ensure flow continues even if notifications fail
- Verified purchase order creation with correct line type detection
- Confirmed notifications are sent to both buyer and seller

### 3. âœ… Won Auctions Not Appearing in Purchase Tracking
**Problem**: Buyers couldn't see their won auctions in the "Ù¾ÛŒÚ¯ÛŒØ±ÛŒ Ø®Ø±ÛŒØ¯" section.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Ensured purchase orders are created immediately after payment
- Verified that purchase orders appear in buyer's dashboard
- Confirmed proper status tracking (pending â†’ in progress â†’ completed)
