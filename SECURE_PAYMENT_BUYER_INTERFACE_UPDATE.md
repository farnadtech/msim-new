# 🎉 Secure Payment Buyer Interface Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Confirm/Reject Buttons
**Location**: `components/SecurePaymentsDisplay.tsx`

**What Changed**:
- Removed the "Confirm" (تایید) button that released funds to seller
- Removed the "Reject" (لغو) button from the main table
- Kept only the "Withdraw" (برداشت) and "Cancel" (لغو) buttons

**Why**:
- Buyers should only see "Withdraw" button initially
- This blocks the money without transferring to seller

### 2. Added Delivery Method Modal for Zero-Line SIMs
**Location**: `components/SecurePaymentsDisplay.tsx`

**Workflow**:
1. Buyer clicks "Withdraw" button
2. System checks if SIM is zero-line or active
3. **If zero-line**: Shows modal asking delivery method
   - 📱 Activation Code (کد فعالسازی)
   - 📮 Physical Delivery (ارسال فیزیکی)
4. **If active**: Directly blocks the money without modal

**Modal Options**:
- **Activation Code**: "لطفاً برای دریافت کد فعالسازی منتظر بمانید"
- **Physical Delivery**: "فروشنده باید مدارک را ارسال کند"

### 3. Fund Blocking Only (No Transfer to Seller)
**Location**: `services/api-supabase.ts` - `withdrawSecurePaymentFunds()`

**Current Behavior** (Already Correct):
When buyer withdraws funds:
- ✅ Money moves from wallet_balance → blocked_balance
- ✅ SIM card is locked to this buyer
- ✅ Transaction record is created
- ✅ NO transfer to seller happens yet

The funds stay in blocked_balance until the full purchase is completed (line delivery confirmed).

## User Experience Flow

### For Zero-Line SIMs
```
1. Buyer sees secure payment in table
2. Buyer clicks "Withdraw" (برداشت)
3. System shows modal: "Choose delivery method"
4. Buyer selects:
   - "Activation Code" → Money blocked, waits for code
   - "Physical Delivery" → Money blocked, waits for docs
5. Money stays in blocked_balance
6. Buyer goes to "Purchase Tracking" to verify code
7. After delivery confirmed, money transfers to seller
```

### For Active Lines
```
1. Buyer sees secure payment in table
2. Buyer clicks "Withdraw" (برداشت)
3. Money blocked immediately
4. No modal (no delivery method needed for active)
5. Money stays in blocked_balance
6. After line delivery confirmed, money transfers to seller
```

### Seller's View
- Sees payment status
- **Before withdraw**: "منتظر برداشت خریدار" (Waiting for buyer to withdraw)
- **After withdraw**: "منتظر تحویل خط" (Waiting for line delivery)

## Technical Details

- Removed `handleReleasePayment()` 
- Added `handleDeliveryMethodSelect()` for modal

## Button States

✅ All modules transformed correctly  
✅ No TypeScript errors

### Testing Checklist
1. ✅ Only "Withdraw" and "Cancel" buttons visible

3. ✅ Money blocks on withdraw (not transferred to seller)
4. ✅ Zero-line SIMs show delivery method modal
5. ✅ Active lines skip modal

## Notes

- The payment system now has a clear separation:
  - **Withdraw**: Blocks money in buyer account
  - **Line Delivery**: Transfers to seller
  - **Completion**: Final transaction
  
- Zero-line SIMs get delivery method choice (same as auctions)
- Active lines auto-proceed (same as auctions)
- Buyer sees same interface for both payment types
- All money is properly tracked and blocked until delivery confirmed

## Deployment

- All changes are safe to deploy
- No database schema changes needed
- Uses existing tables and relationships
- Backward compatible with existing payments
