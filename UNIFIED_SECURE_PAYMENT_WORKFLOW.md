# 🎉 Unified Secure Payment Workflow for Both Line Types

## Overview
Implemented unified workflow for secure payments where both active and inactive lines follow the same process:
1. Buyer withdraws funds → Money blocked in account
2. Status shows "در انتظار تحویل خط" (Waiting for line delivery)
3. Buyer goes to "Purchase Tracking" to complete line delivery
4. After delivery confirmation → Payment automatically completed

## Changes Made

### 1. Unified withdrawSecurePaymentFunds Function
**Location**: `services/api-supabase.ts`

**What Changed**:
- Removed automatic completion logic for active lines
- Both active and inactive lines now follow the same workflow
- Funds are blocked (wallet → blocked_balance) for both types
- Status shows "در انتظار تحویل خط" for both types

**Workflow** (Same for both line types):
1. Buyer clicks "Withdraw" button
2. System blocks funds (wallet → blocked_balance)
3. SIM card locked to this payment
4. Status shows "در انتظار تحویل خط"
5. Buyer must go to "Purchase Tracking" to complete delivery
6. After delivery confirmation → Payment completed automatically

### 2. Updated SecurePaymentsDisplay Component
**Location**: `components/SecurePaymentsDisplay.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed auto-completion notification for active lines
- Both line types show same "در انتظار تحویل خط" status
- Active lines show info notification after withdrawal
- No delivery method modal for active lines (goes directly to tracking)

## User Experience Flow

### For Both Active and Inactive Lines
```
1. Buyer sees secure payment in table
2. Buyer clicks "Withdraw" (برداشت)
3. System blocks funds (wallet → blocked_balance)
4. Status shows: "⏳ در انتظار تحویل خط"
5. Buyer goes to "Purchase Tracking" section
6. Completes line delivery process:
   - For inactive: Enter activation code
   - For active: Document verification
7. System automatically completes payment:
   - Unblocks funds from buyer
   - Transfers to seller (minus 2% commission)
   - Marks SIM as sold
   - Updates payment status to completed
8. Both parties receive completion notifications
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Logic in withdrawSecurePaymentFunds
```typescript
// BEFORE (had auto-completion for active lines):
if (simCard.is_active) {
    // Complete payment immediately for active lines
    await completeSecurePaymentForActiveLine(...);
} else {
    // Block funds only for inactive lines
    // ... fund blocking logic
}

// AFTER (unified workflow):
// FOR BOTH ACTIVE AND INACTIVE LINES:
// Just block the funds and show "در انتظار تحویل خط" status
// Deduct amount from buyer's wallet and add to blocked_balance
// ... unified fund blocking logic for both types
```

### Status Display
```typescript
// Both line types show same status:
{(payment as any).withdrawn_at && payment.status !== 'completed' && (
    <span className="inline-block bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 px-2 py-1 rounded text-xs">
        ⏳ در انتظار تحویل خط
    </span>
)}
```
