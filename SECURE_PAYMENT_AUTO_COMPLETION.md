# 🎉 Secure Payment Auto-Completion for Active Lines

## Overview
Implemented automatic completion of secure payments for active SIM lines. When a buyer withdraws funds for an active line, the payment is immediately completed and the line is marked as sold, without requiring additional confirmation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced withdrawSecurePaymentFunds Function
**Location**: `services/api-supabase.ts`

**What Changed**:
- Added logic to detect if SIM line is active or inactive
- For **active lines**: Complete payment immediately after fund withdrawal
- For **inactive lines**: Block funds only (existing behavior)

**Workflow**:
1. Buyer clicks "Withdraw" button
2. System checks if SIM is active (`is_active` field)
3. **If active**: 
   - Block funds (wallet → blocked_balance)
   - Immediately unblock and transfer to seller
   - Mark SIM as sold
   - Update payment status to completed
   - Create commission record
   - Send completion notifications
4. **If inactive**:
   - Block funds only
   - Show delivery method modal
   - Wait for line delivery confirmation

### 2. Added completeSecurePaymentForActiveLine Function
**Location**: `services/api-supabase.ts`

**Purpose**: Handle immediate completion of active line payments

**Process**:
- Unblocks money from buyer's blocked_balance
- Transfers funds to seller's wallet (minus 2% commission)
- Marks SIM card as sold
- Updates purchase order status to completed
- Updates secure payment status to completed
- Creates transaction records
- Records commission
- Sends notifications to both parties

### 3. Updated SecurePaymentsDisplay Component
**Location**: `components/SecurePaymentsDisplay.tsx`

**Changes**:
- For active lines: Show success notification after withdrawal
- No delivery method modal for active lines
- Status shows "✅ تکمیل شد" when completed

## User Experience Flow

### For Active Lines (New Behavior)
```
1. Buyer sees secure payment in table
2. Buyer clicks "Withdraw" (برداشت)
3. System blocks funds (wallet → blocked_balance)
4. System IMMEDIATELY completes payment:
   - Unblocks funds
   - Transfers to seller (minus commission)
   - Marks SIM as sold
5. Buyer sees: "✅ تکمیل شد" status
6. Seller receives notification with amount
```

### For Inactive Lines (Existing Behavior)
```
1. Buyer sees secure payment in table
2. Buyer clicks "Withdraw" (برداشت)
3. System shows delivery method modal
4. Buyer chooses delivery method
5. System blocks funds only
6. Buyer sees: "⏳ در انتظار تحویل خط" status
7. After delivery confirmed, payment completes
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Logic in withdrawSecurePaymentFunds
```typescript
// Check if SIM is active
const { data: simCard } = await supabase
    .from('sim_cards')
    .select('is_active')
    .eq('id', payment.sim_card_id)
    .single();

if (simCard.is_active) {
    // Complete payment immediately for active lines
    await completeSecurePaymentForActiveLine(securePaymentId, payment, purchaseOrder);
} else {
    // Block funds only for inactive lines (existing behavior)
    // ... fund blocking logic
}
```

### Auto-Completion Process
```typescript
const completeSecurePaymentForActiveLine = async (
    securePaymentId: number,
    payment: any,
    purchaseOrder: any
): Promise<void> => {
    // 1. Unblock buyer's funds
    // 2. Transfer to seller (minus commission)
    // 3. Mark SIM as sold
    // 4. Update statuses
    // 5. Create records
    // 6. Send notifications
}
```
