# ðŸŽ‰ Fix for "SIM Card No Longer Available" Error in Auctions

## Issue Description
When users won auctions for inactive (zero) line SIM cards and tried to select a delivery method, they encountered the error:
```
Ø§ÛŒÙ† Ø³ÛŒÙ…Ú©Ø§Ø±Øª Ø¯ÛŒÚ¯Ø± Ø¯Ø± Ø¯Ø³ØªØ±Ø³ Ù†ÛŒØ³Øª
(This SIM card is no longer available)
```

## Root Cause
The SIM card was being marked as "sold" too early in the auction completion process, before the delivery method selection was completed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed SIM Card Status Management**
Updated `services/api-supabase.ts` in the `completeAuctionPurchaseForWinner` function:
- Removed the check that prevented processing if SIM was already "sold"
- SIM cards now remain in "available" status until delivery is complete
- Only creates a purchase order with "pending" status

### 2. **Fixed Delivery Method Selection**
Updated `pages/SimDetailsPage.tsx` in the `handleDeliveryMethodSelect` function:
- Added special handling for auction winners
- Creates purchase order without marking SIM as sold
- For zero-line SIMs, creates activation request
- Navigates to buyer dashboard for purchase tracking

### 3. **Proper Workflow Sequence**
The new workflow ensures:
1. User wins auction
2. Clicks "ØªÚ©Ù…ÛŒÙ„ Ø­Ø±Ø§Ø¬ÛŒ"
3. Money is blocked (not deducted)
4. SIM remains "available"
5. Purchase order created with "pending" status
6. User selects delivery method
7. Activation request created (for zero lines)
8. Only after successful delivery:
   - Money is transferred to seller
   - SIM is marked as "sold"
   - Commission is recorded

## Key Changes

### In `services/api-supabase.ts`:
```typescript
// REMOVED this check:
// if (simData.status !== 'available') {
//     throw new Error('Ø§ÛŒÙ† Ø³ÛŒÙ…Ú©Ø§Ø±Øª Ø¯ÛŒÚ¯Ø± Ø¯Ø± Ø¯Ø³ØªØ±Ø³ Ù†ÛŒØ³Øª.');
// }

// CHANGED to keep SIM available:
status: 'pending', // Pending until line delivery is complete
```

### In `pages/SimDetailsPage.tsx`:
```typescript
// ADDED special handling for auction winners:
if (sim.type === 'auction') {
    // Check if user is the auction winner
    const isWinner = sim.auction_details?.highest_bidder_id === currentUser.id;
    const isAuctionEnded = sim.auction_details && new Date(sim.auction_details.end_time) < new Date();
    
    if (isWinner && isAuctionEnded) {
        // Create purchase order without marking SIM as sold
        // ... rest of the logic
    }
}
```
